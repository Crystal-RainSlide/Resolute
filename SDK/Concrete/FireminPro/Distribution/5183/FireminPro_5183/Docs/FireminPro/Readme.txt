Description
--------------------------------------------------

Firemin Server is a small yet powerful tool for minimizing the impact multiple browser sessions has on a Windows Server's resources. More specifically, it will minimize memory usage of multiple browser sessions on for example a terminal server. Now you can confidently allow users to use Firefox and not worry about precious server memory being abused. This is especially useful on low memory servers. 

Firemin Server has a small resource footprint and easy to use. Even though it was developed for optimizing Firefox's memory usage, it can be used to optimize the memory usage of any stubborn program.
